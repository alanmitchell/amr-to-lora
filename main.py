'''Script to read utility meter transmissions and transmit the reading to a 
LoRaWAN network through a SEEED E5 module.

This script assumes the RTL-SDR Software Defined Radio is based on R820T2 tuner and 
RTL2832U chips.

This script assumes that the program rtl_tcp is already running. (I tried starting
it within this script, but it then captured keystrokes such as Ctrl-C.).
